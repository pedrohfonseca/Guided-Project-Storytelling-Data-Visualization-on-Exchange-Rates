# Guided Project: Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

### Project Informations
*   Solution to the guided project Storytelling Data Visualization on Exchange Rates on [Dataquest](dataquest.io)
*   In this project, we compared the exchange rate of euro with american dollar and make a data visualization.
The data visualization was made using storyteller to see the changes of rate over the years.
We also used Gestalt Principles and Pre-Attentive Attributes to improve our graphs and used the FiveThirdyEight style on matplotlib.

Pytest was used through unit tests in the implemented functions and the resulting Code was evaluated by Pylint, obtaining a score of 10.0.
